# DPG AI Projects

This repository contains AI-related projects for the Digital Proving Ground (DPG).

## Backend: `zscaler-ollama` Docker Setup

The `backend/` directory contains a Dockerized setup for running the Ollama Large Language Model (LLM) server. This setup is specifically configured to operate within corporate networks that utilize TLS/SSL inspection (e.g., Zscaler), making it suitable for secure enterprise environments like those in the DOD and military.

For detailed information on what Ollama is, how this Docker setup works, why Zscaler is relevant, and comprehensive instructions for building, running, and managing the `zscaler-ollama` container and its models, please refer to the dedicated README:
